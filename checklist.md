## Páginas 404,500

## Adicionar <svelte:head> em todo as páginas

## API pagination options

Our API is currently missing pagination options, which could be very needed depending on the number of posts.

## API Post

Another possible future enhancement would be adding the post’s content to the returned JSON, which we don’t do currently. The “resolver” function offers a `default.render` method for that, if you so choose. (We saw it previously, in the `src/routes/[slug]/+page.js` file.)
